We wanted our program to tell us what season it is based on two inputs, the number of hours of daylight and the color of the leaves. Dalight hours range from 7 to 15, and leaf colors are green, yellow, red, and none. The seasons are Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. If the days are short (9 or less daylight hours), and the leaves are none, then it is Winter. If the days are long (13 or more daylight hours), and the leaves are green, then it is Summer. If the daylight hours are 10, 11, or 12, then the season is dependent on the leaf color. If the leaves are green, then it is Spring, but if they are red or yellow, then it is Fall. We chose this problem because it was similar to a more complex squirl-play problem, but was not exceedingly difficult. 

We set up this problem by giving the program the set of materials from the problem description (7, 10, 13, 15, G, Y, R, N, Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) as well as boolean, integer, string stacks, and exec-if. We looked for our answer as the top of the string stack. We setup test cases for every possible valid daylight and leaf color pair to test against.

Our initial runs of the program continued to simplify to just guessing Spring, as it was an easy guess and answered 1/4 of the test cases correctly.
